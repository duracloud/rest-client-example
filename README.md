# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example for interacting with the DuraCloud REST APIs using the DuraCloud Java client.

# Requirements

The following tools will be required:
* Java SDK - either Java 7 or Java 8 will work
* Maven - testing of this code has used version 3.2.5
* Git - to pull down the code (if you're prefer to not use Git, you can also just download the zip of this code)

# Usage
1. Retrieve the code (using either git or the zip download option)
2. On the command line, 'cd' to the project directory and run: 'mvn clean install'
3. On the command line, 'cd' to the project target directory and execute the example: 'java -jar simpleapiexample-1.0-driver.jar'
4. A list will be printed to the terminal with the parameters you need to include in order to execute the code. Add the parameters to the command line call above, and watch the magic happen.
5. Update the code with your own tests and experiments. This is meant as a starting point for you to build your own tools. Enjoy!
